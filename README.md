Useful resources to start learning ReactJs - A Mike's personal bookmark list 

Some days ago I started learning ReactJs. Over the web you can find a ton of resources, videos and courses. But everything is a mess. 
I'll put here every page I think is interesting to share, in order to follow a straight line to understand and start working with React.
